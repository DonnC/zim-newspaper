        library to get newspaper, news from zim leading news providers
        
        ### Example
        ``` py
        from newspaperzw.Provider import Providers
        from newspaperzw.news import News
        
        # add your favourite news source so as to use its name only when getting news data
        p = Providers(provider={'techzim': 'https://www.techzim.co.zw/'})
        
        # get all preset news sources and url
        all = Providers().getAll()
        
        try:
          # get data from news site by name, default = `herald`
          api       = News(provider='techzim')
          news_data =  api.paper()
          
          # return dict with all news data, best to use `prettyprinter`
          print(new_data)
          
        except Exception as e:
          print("There was a problem: ", e)
        ```
        
        ## Get summary of article
        - to get summary through NLP function, ```nltk``` is needed as dependent
        - this returns same results as above but with a summary attribute that contains a summary of the article
        
        ```py
        from newspaperzw.Provider import Providers
        from newspaperzw.news import News
        
        try:
          # get data from news site by name, default = `herald`
          api       = News(provider='techzim', summary=True)
          news_data =  api.paper()
          
          # return dict with all news data, best to use `prettyprinter`
          print(new_data)
          
        except Exception as e:
          print("There was a problem: ", e)
        ```
        
        ### NEW! 
        #### added flag to set or disable cache 
        ```py
        # __version__1.1.0
        
        from newspaperzw.Provider import Providers
        from newspaperzw.news import News
        
        '''
        	get a summary of the article from each article through the `summary=True` flag
        	avoid cache memory by disabling it through the `cache=False` flag
        	if cache is True, it will not return news previously downloaded on previous runs
        '''
        
        try:
          # get data from news site by name, default = `herald`
          api       = News(provider='techzim', summary=True, cache=False)
          news_data =  api.paper()
          
          # return dict with all news data, best to use `prettyprinter`
          print(new_data)
          
        except Exception as e:
          print("There was a problem: ", e)
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        - library scrapes all available data that it encounters, need to narrow it down by date/month/year
        - start from `today` up to any news obtained from `last year`
        - improve speed
        - disble logging
        - date published
        
        - log files need to be deleted in case they occupy signficant space on disk
